# QAOA
This is a repository which includes my python codes related to the QAOA

The file "Fidelity_vs_magnetic_field.ipynb" includes a simulation of the trend of the fidelity with respect to the magnetic field of the Ising hamiltonian with transverse field
The file "Simulation_Ising_INTERP.ipynb" includes the main functions involved in the simulation of the QAOA with Qiskit
