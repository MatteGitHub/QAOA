# QAOA
This is a repository which includes my python codes related to the QAOA

The file "Fidelity_vs_magnetic_field.ipynb" includes a simulation of the trend of the fidelity with respect to the magnetic field of the Ising hamiltonian with transverse field
The file "Simulation_Ising_INTERP.ipynb" includes the main functions involved in the simulation of the QAOA with Qiskit 
The file "Analysis_time_saving_wrong_INTERP.ipynb" includes an analysis on the time saved when applying some transferability-based strategies together with the INTERP routine
The file "Comparison_classical_optimizers_with_INTERP" includes a comparison between several local search algorithms in terms of computational step, computational time and solution quality (fidelity) in solving the same task
